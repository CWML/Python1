## Getting Started with Data Analysis & Visualization: Introduction to Python (Python 1)
Are you ready to take the first steps in using code to work with data? In this training, you’ll learn how to use Python, one of the most popular programming languages, to analyze and visualize data. This training welcomes first-time coders and Python beginners, so we’ll begin with Python programming fundamentals before moving on to the basics of data analysis and visualization later in the training.

### In this 2-hour in-person session, you'll learn how to:

Describe and use basic Python concepts  (e.g., strings, integers, printing, variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, conditional logic, etc.) Handle mistakes in coding Use add-on modules (I.e., import libraries) for Python, including numpy and matplotlib Read data into Python Perform basic statistical operations on data Create basic plots from data

### What to know about this session:

This training will be hands-on; come ready to code alongside the instructor. Details about technical setup will be emailed to registrants a few days before the course begins. Please note that registration is required for this event.
